I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This week I have discovered my abilities to be able to make sufficent blog type posts like this one. While some of the steps where a bit complicated, I had learned what code I needed to do to create an new page. Once, I had discovered that I did have bit of an problem figuruing out on how to get this post onto the our Hugo page. But, I had figured it out and the thing was that I was forgetting to open my file and put the post on explorer. But after some tracing back and forth I had figured the right keys.
