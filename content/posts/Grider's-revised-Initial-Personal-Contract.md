<p>
A <br/>
I will create and develop a thorough description of what our placebo company (About Page). I will describe the roles of our team, our mission, and our approach to executing mission and a breif but detailed message of our support to the python learning community. The design should be a very suitable for our group. 

B <br/>
I will create a adequate about page. Providing some details of our mission, our teams roles, and approach to mission and support. Along with a well laid out page design. 

C <br/>
I will create a basic About Page. Providing little details of our teams background, mission, and support. No details of approach of our mission included. A plain page design/layout.

D <br/>
I will create a short statement of team within About Page. I won't include details mission, approach to mission, nor our support. No design or changes to pages layout from defaulted layout. 

E <br/>
I wont have anything provided for our About Page. Nor design.

Differences from Orginal Contract:
 
I didn't make any drastic changes from the original contract. The reason I say this is because I feel that my original guidelines has great measurements into what each grade should look like.  I only changed the wording of some of the guidelines for each grade level, I only did to lighten up the expectations for the level. The reason for this is because I'm starting to realizing my limitations and skill level of meeting such expectations. For example, I dont necessarily know how to do design within wordpress but within that. But, I've realized that our groups theme somewhat takes care of soem designing details. At this point I feel like I'm on the track to get a B+.
