I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. The reason I say this is because of last Sunday's annotated reading. The article "Checking the Box: How CMS Feature Support Is Not a Binary Question" exposed me to concepts I didn't know. Deane Barker talks about how CMS features have different ways in how CMS feature supports. And when speaking of the subject CMS, it is more about how to set feature operates, not if it is present. Also, there's little binary within CMS. So, he created a list of possible how there could be support from a CMS Which I had not thought of necessarily before. For example, some support or features are activated by configuration, and some support is going through the expected development. I didn't understand the concept before, but it means the development that you have to put in when integrating a system. This concept is valuable in (web) content management because knowing this explains how to get the support that you may need and that you may have to do different executions within a CMS to get the support of set-so-feature.
