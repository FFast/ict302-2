This week for the site I updated the teams page of what I need to finish up for the site. The biggest thing right now for us is getting the pages to flow. The content is almost done with about 3 spots needed to be done and the home and download page will be complete. Using teams more and more has made me realize how much I like having a workflow system to keep me in check of stuff to do.
