Hugo and WordPress are different in various ways. The first thing I noticed about WordPress is that it had a comments section, which makes it better for communication when building a website, in such ways as we are doing in class. I also noticed that there's a  place to upload media within WordPress that I don't see provided for Hugo, which I know there is probably code needed for users to upload such media entities. With WordPress, you can see what your page looks like as you're going through the process of adding such things to it. While for Hugo you have to go through the local server to see what's outputted within your webpage. Both content management sites have the main page to the websites and pages for the posts individually. I believe you can add tags to both sites though, there is a separate section for that on WordPress, which probably makes it easier to find access to certain posts. I don't mind the back coding required for Hugo because that allows more options for personal customizations for the users of the sites. WordPress very much can do something that Hugo couldn't.  For example, there is access to communication within the WordPress site which wasn't available within Hugo. There's a way to create categories for posts that make the upkeep for the posts more accessible.
