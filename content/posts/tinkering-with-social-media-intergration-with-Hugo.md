Yesterday in class we discussed about what social media accounts  we woanted to be connected to our Hugo site. So, we statred listing know social media sites that can be connetced to our site. Now, so far I know that we had agreed on having Twitter and Github connected to our site. Unfornately though we were not able to create such interlinks between platforms. Which I know we will be able to complete sometime soon.
