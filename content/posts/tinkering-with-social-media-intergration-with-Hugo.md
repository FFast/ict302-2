Yesterday in class we discussed about what social media accounts  we wanted to be connected to our Hugo site. So, we started listing know social media sites that can be connetced to our site. Now, so far I know that we had agreed on having Twitter and Github connected to our site. Unfornately, though we were not able to create such interlinks between platforms. Which I know we will be able to complete sometime soon. This very much involves the concept topic for Module 7 because within this moduel we are Multichannel Distribution. Which means having some displaying content into others channels outside of your main domain, for example my earlier mentionings of Twitter. This is important in the content management process because you want to connect to your users by putting various type of content out in other channels the users demographic may use ot keep them engage and update on anything coming your channel.
