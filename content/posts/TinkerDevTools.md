<p>This week we learned about Plugins and extensions, mainly how helpful some are, but also the negatives that using these plugins might bring about. For the Hugo devtools, some helpful extensions I noticed had to do with the front end of the website. Using a text editor to manage posts works well enough, but sometimes people want a straightforward text box and post function. One I looked into was enwrite, which basically adds the functionality I just mentioned. All you have to do is type your content into a document and post it. The other I looked into was Hokus CMS, which lets you manage your hugo site in a desktop application, which is much more convenient for the average user over the command line or powershell. Both of these exist to streamline the accessibility of Hugo so anyone can use it with minimal prior knowledge. People make extensions in order to help fix an issue they see with a specific program or function. They are normally made in response to an existing software.</p>
