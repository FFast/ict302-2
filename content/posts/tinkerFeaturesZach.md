Hugo:
Platform vs Product: Hugo is much more of a product setting up the site and projects is all on the person and there are multiple ways to go about how you would set it up.

Hugo can be used as a system but every group might implement how they do it differently.

Open source vs commercial: Hugo is open source, we can go in and change the theme and style of how it works even though the base markdown wouldn't change

Management vs Delivery: Hugo focuses on the delivery of content with the way to be able to post and share content, Hugo does work on the back end by coding but it is about the presentation.

installed vs SaaS: Hugo is installed on our GitHub and our devices they are not a subscription service.

code feature vs content features: Styles are still in code files but that is a content feature to use while there is also styling features in markdown for Hugo.

how it is changed: Hugo is based in markdown and changes would be done through code.

type of publishing: Hugo is unidirectional, we can only really post right now on our site ourselves, there are ways to make reply's and likes on posts so that content and communication could be bidirectional.

Practicality vs elegance: This is more so up to the person but I think we can all say that Hugo is practical, unless you are a classic I don't see it as elegant at all.
