I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This past week we had looked into alternative themes for our pages of CSS. I had decided one this particular theme labeled: m10c, since it had this neon green and black concept with white, giving an hacker-ish vibe. The reason I would say using CSS is an concept related to content management is because it's something that does help make an stylized webpage but isn't only way of finding a design for set page. Instead its just an style sheet langauge that is used to explain how HTML elements is  presented.
