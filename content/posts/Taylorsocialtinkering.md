<p>Because our company is advertising a python library, most forms of social media don't exactly fit our image. There is no real benefit to advertise a python library on youtube, and definelty not on tiktok. The only soical media that we should consider would be twitter for social presence of the company, and maybe a link to the github.Social media incorparation doesnt exactly fit in with our theme, but it is helpful for any compnay to have at least some sort of social media presence.
