    <h3>Socials</h3>
    <p>   We agreed that the imprtant socials for our hypothetical organization are GitHub and Twitter. Youtube, instagram, and facebook do not match the tone of out organization, and that goes double for tiktok. We have no need of video based content, and the informal nature of facebook undermines the professional vibes we want. I actually was resistant to adding twitter, but Zach made the good point that it could be like a companies official social media outlet.</p>
