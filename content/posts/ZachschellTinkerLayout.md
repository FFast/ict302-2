Looking through the files some of the code starts to make more sense. When looking at the post and lists we can see a .Title used to pull the tile to the page. in writing this there is a title section right above where I am typing to edit that would change what gets pulled there for the title of the Post. This section I am typing in would be the .Content section and tag used in the code. the { } doubled seems to be how to call the function of whatever you are doing. Within the menu Contextual file, I am able to see the page used to organize the list of posts with tags to describe posts in the taxonomies.
