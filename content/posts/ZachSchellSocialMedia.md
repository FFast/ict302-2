The group today didn't really get how to put the social media tags on the Hugo website. We did figure out that having a twitter, GitHub, and maybe even a stack overflow links on our website might be good as a python library. The ability to share from the forums page as well would lead to the public being able to spread the work of forum posts for help. onto other media channels as a way so the company doesn't have to advertise themselves on their.
