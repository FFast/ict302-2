<p> In Hugo, the primary things I can do are making new posts, and editing with inline HTML. I already knew how to do both of these in Wordpress, but I do like the terminal focus of Hugo. Maybe it just makes me feel like I'm in War Games, but I kinda liked the way Hugo worked. That said, Wordpress is way easier. That said, if I were going to build a website in a day, I would use Hugo.</p>
