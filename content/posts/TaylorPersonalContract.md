<p>
I will be in charge of creating the forum page, which will allow users to interact with the company and each other in order to better use our product. It will help users troubleshoot problems they may have and ask the community questions in a public format. “A” work will be that the page works perfectly and flows well with the look and the feel of the other member’s work. “B” work would be that everything in my part works well, but may not necessarily mesh perfectly with the other pages. “C” work consists of the forum missing some functionality or everything doesn’t work as intended.
