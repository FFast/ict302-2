<p>
Our group has decided to take a content specific approach with the way we will divide the work. Each person is in charge of creating one page for the website, with the exception of one person, who will create 2. I will be in charge of creating the forum page, which will allow users to interact with the company and each other in order to better use our product. It will help users troubleshoot problems they may have and ask the community questions in a public format. Our editing process will be each person checks anothers work. Once Im finished with my content, Aaliyah will check over my work. I will look over Zachs work. This approach will allow us to better focus on our task, without causing too many people doing too many tasks.
