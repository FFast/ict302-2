This week we had created a dummy hugo site version of WordPress. In order to have an idea of our goal with this dummy site we had looked over an example of Hugo, which had extensive coding. After looking over such sample our tech lead had decided for us to make an version of WordPress thorugh a new hugo site. I had a bit of trouble to figuring the ends and outs of it. But to my idea I had started to make an code similar to the sample. So, I could get an idea of what I needed to be prepared to do. I had looked into each of the files and began to start coding my version of our dummy Hugo site. Overall, this activity showed us the importance knowing how certain content management systems works and to what level can these systems assist us on. For Hugo, you have make most of the code to get the page up and running to a certain aptitude. While for WordPress there should be a bit more assistance on making the design and layouts for the pages.
