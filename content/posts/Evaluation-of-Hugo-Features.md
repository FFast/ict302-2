In terms of CMS features we discussed on Monday. I would say that Hugo falls into these particular categories:

- Platform: This CMS implementation, Hugo, is more an of platform to where you can work on producing content from the back-ended coding. 

- CMS implementation: I would say this platform is mainly an CMS implementation instead of an CMS by itself. Mainly for the fact that most of the coding or editoral process happens on another platform GitHub Desktop.

- Open Source: You can create an Hugo page free of charge, plus for downloading GitHub Desktop, you dont have to pay to gain access and create server. 

- Technology Stack: Hugo is written in Go programming language.

- Content Delivery: I would say that this platform implements more of content devilery than content management. The reason I say this is because you are not able to do much with the content after its get published than before. 

- Installed: The reason I would argure that this app is an installed app is because you have to download github which is where the coding and content creation creation happens for Hugo. Especially, since Hugo is not an CMS all by itself.

- Code Features: I believe that this platform more provides an option of coding fetures than content features. 

- Changes through code: I think there is more of an impact on site when its comes to changing of code since, Hugo is more of an simplistic CMS implemented platform. Especially, since you have to go through its base (GitHub) to even make set changes. 

- Biderectional: This platform is bidirectional (in my opinion) because it goes through through an platform (GitHub) for its content to be pushed into the sites display.

- Practicality: The Hugo platform is more of an focus for  having the accurate code than its than having an really nice layout.
