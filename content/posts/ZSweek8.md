This week within WordPress I got the home page fully set up and turned to be the front page when the site loads, I am proud that I can figure my way around WordPress some and able to start building a small site. The weeks Themes and Presentation was a thought when making the layout for the home page with the other pages. We want everything to flow well and We are achieving that.
