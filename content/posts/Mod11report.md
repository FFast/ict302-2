<p> I can find and use resources for self-directed learning is the statement for the week. Since this weeks topic was abouthow to extend CMS's I looked into how sites like youtube and tiktok handle content moderation. YOutube has a report system, as well as a bot that scans through for acts of violence, sexual content, nudity, or hate speech symbols and if the content contains any of the above themes, it is autoflagged and taken down. From what I have found about tiktok, there are people who get paid to manually filter through reported content, and remove content accoording to their guidelines. THese forms of moderation both have their own issues, such as the youtube automod removing the Jan 6th video in our readings.</p>
