I can descibe and compare content management systems. This past week we had just started working/exploring the WordPress platform. We got to explore some of the most notable functions of WordPress, for one like I had mentioned on my tinkering assignment last week, I had noticied how there an accessibility of open communication within this particular CMS. Unlike the previous CMS we have worked on, Hugo, which doesnt have a place for commentary amongust users. Also, there's more ways to keep your work organized within  WordPress, one of its many functions allows to the have separate files of your work. While wihtin Hugo there isnt really place to separate documentation of code and information as well as this CMS.
