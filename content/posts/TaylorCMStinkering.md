<p>One of the CMS's I looked at was Joomla. THis stuck out to me becasue it is well known that it is confusing to use, if youve never had experience designing websites. It is marketed towards devolpers and website creators, which is not very common. Many CMS's make it a point to make it as easy as possible to get started, even if you know nothing. THis is where Joomla seems to have an edge, because it is aware of its niche and doesn't cater to everybody. They know their audience and will make their experience better, at the cost of the general ease of use. It is also open-source, which is really important for products like this, who will likely have a small but driven community. They will be able to create plugins in order to make some features more usable, but because the target audience is so small, it doesnt have as many extensions as a easier to CMS like wordpress.   </p>
