This week our class did an did an dummy group website in Hugo. Introduced to this assignment by an Anake sample site and its code for the cite. The goal of the assignment was to see the amount of work goes into making code for a decently designed and coordinated Hugo site. For today we started creating our Personal Contracts. But, before we had did so we had discussed what roles and pages that we would be creating or doing. In this group we have five main pages for our fake python company website. For each member had one page to complete besides our tech member of the group.
