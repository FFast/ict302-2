I can somewhat identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. The reason that backs my statement is that I do understand to a degree what content management what it actually is. For example, I can define what content is: 'content is something produced by humans for human consumption.' Also, I understand the importance that an estabilshed workflow when it comes to producing an content management system.

I can partially identity and compare content management systems. By the time our class started to explore a little bit of WordPress. I was able to identify the differences it's system had to Hugo. For exmaple, I was able to indentify and recognize that the was an comment section that enabled for people to communicate within its system. While Hugo didtn't have such function availble in its system.

I can kind of manage content using established workflows. During week 4, our class created workflows on Microsoft Teams. I had set up our group's Microsoft teams account along with the basis of buckets we could use while our list of tasks. After creating a workflow,  I hadn't necessarily used it to measure my progress within our group work. While I do have the basic knowledge of the function of our established workflow. This is a task created under the To Do bucket, task can be moved over as your progression develops from the buckets: Drafts, In Progress, and Needs for Editing. Once marking a task as completed, your group can work on other essential tasks. When needing communication, you can make a post that will be available for all groups to see or reply to under the Posts section which allows group mates to communicate with each other along with the video and conversation feature. 

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. As previously mentioned, I created a workflow for our group to use within our progress of updating our WordPress page. This workflow in itself is not part of content management. Instead, it's a technology that helps with the measurement of progression for a such content management system. 

I can find resources for self-directed learning. In week 3, our group had to work on our initial Group Contract. This contract is a published  Hugo post. That gives our group our guidline into the progression of our playing parts within this project. It establishes a standard for us to follow as we develop our work. The grades that were correlated to certain performance levels gave us an idea of what aspects to achieve when completing parts of our contribution to our groups' page.
