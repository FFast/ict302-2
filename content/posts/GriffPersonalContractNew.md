<body>
    <p>   I will do the Documentation page. This will include at least 5 functions, with examaples and usage. Zach will cover the header with the Home Page, and the Download page. It is my responsibility that my page includes what we agreed to, and flows with the rest of the site, in terms of style. Including the mentioned items will result in a B, and an A if they fit witht he style of the site (as outlined in the group contract). I will not publish anything until Zach looks it over.</p>

    <h3>Revised Personal Contract:</h3>
    <p>   I will do the Documentation page. This will include at least 5 functions, with examaples and usage. Zach will cover the header with the Home Page, and the Download page. It is my responsibility that my page includes what we agreed to, and flows with the rest of the site, in terms of style. Including the mentioned items will result in a B, and an A if they fit with the style of the site (as outlined in the group contract). I am also going to ensure the download page has the correct console commands for conda and pip, if our library was to exist. My group has expressed they are satisfied with how the documentation page looks. I have yet to fill in most of the functions, but I have written plenty of documentation before, this is not a challenging, nor truly time consuming endeavour. If I have extra time, I will write the library for real, and the site will be good for something other than a grade and practice.</p>
