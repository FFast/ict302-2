<p>This week, our group touched base on where everyone is at with our specific parts to make sure everyone was on the same page with how the project is going. Since we have all of the main components in place and are finishing up on the details, everyone is working independently, with some question being asked among ourselves to refine how the pages intertwine with eachother thematically. The whole process is going very smoothly and so far we have had no major problems with the project.</p>
