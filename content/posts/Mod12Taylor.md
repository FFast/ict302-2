<p>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. This week I was looking at themes specially for the forums page, in order to try and get it to match the theme of the hoge and download pages. At least I was confused how to go about this, but the forum feature actually has some built in tools to assist in customization. Until I looked into how the plugin works, I assumed it only helped with functionality, not design.</p>
