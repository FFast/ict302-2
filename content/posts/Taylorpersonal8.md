<p>This week I had to use resources for my own learning, becuase I had to look around to make the forums have an option to allow anonymous users to interact with it. I found the setting in wordpress, but had to explore options to see if there were any better ways. As it turns out the way I did it was the best and easiest way to allow anyone to interact with our support forums.</p>
