    <h3>Platform vs Product</h3>
    <p>   As we have seen, Hugo is most definitely not a finished product. We aren't going to a Lazy Boy store and picking one out and having it delivered, we are looking at what we want at Ikea and hoping we grab the right box of parts. </p>
    <h3>CMS or CMS Implementation</h3>
    <p>   Similarly, we are not having Lazy Boy come in and do everything for us, we are building our chair/site ourselves. </p>
    <h3>Open Source or Commercial</h3>
    <p>   Hugo is both open source and non-commercial. This means we can see all the code that makes up Hugo, and there is no paid option for Hugo, just the free download/install.</p>
    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>   Hugo itself is written in Go, but using Hugo requires a text editor, Markdown, and TOML/json for the configuration files. </p>
    <h3>Content Management vs Content Delivery</h3>
    <p>   There is the ability to integrate Google Analytics into the site, and this allows the site owner to see user statistics, but I would not call this delivery.</p>
    <h3>Installed vs SaaS</h3>
    <p>   You install Hugo onto whatever you want, for free. You could pay someone else to do that for you, but that is not the question. </p>
    <h3>Changes Through Code vs Changes Through Configuration</h3>
    <p>   Where does this fall if I coded a change into the configuration? I mean I would generally call it configuration, but I cannot tell if I'm overthinking or underthinking.</p>
    <h3>Unidirectional vs Bidirectional publishing</h3>
    <p>   Hugo includes Disqus, which allows for users to comment on the site. Whether or not this truly consititutes user-generated content is a philosophical one, but I would say that given the binary, I would say that no it does not, as the comments can be turned off without the site really changing all that much. </p>
    <h3>Practicality vs Elegance</h3>
    <p>   Swiss Army Knife or Toolbox? Two hours of coding can save you 10 minutes of reading planning.</p>
