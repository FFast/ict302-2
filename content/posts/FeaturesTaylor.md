<p>Platform vs Product: Hugo is a product setting up the site. There are many options a person can use to set up the site differently from others.</p>
<p>Open-source vs commercial: Hugo is open source, so you can go in and change things like the themes and how the website looks, but the barebones functionality is still there. You can change certain things, like if you want to be able to code in html, but the Hugo site itself will still mainly be markdown.</p>
<p>Management vs Delivery: Hugo focuses on the content being presentable to those who want to see it. It is a medium to present content first, many blogs I’ve seen are used by creators to express themselves, and most are based on Hugo. </p>
<p>installed vs SaaS: Hugo is installed on our GitHub and our devices they are not a subscription service. </p>
<p>code feature vs content features: Styles are in code files that you can implement. These would be content features.</p>
<p>how it is changed: Hugo is written in markdown and changes would be done through coding.</p>
<p>type of publishing: Hugo is unidirectional, we can post on our site, but we don’t have features implemented where others can interact with our content. If this was the case it would be bidirectional.</p>
<p>Practicality vs elegance: This is extremely subjective, however I would argue that Hugo is extremely practical, and it is up to the user to make it elegant.</p>
