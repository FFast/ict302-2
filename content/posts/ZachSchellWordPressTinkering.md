Within Hugo we have been able to make a blog website to upload these posts very simply within a design. WordPress also has a similar format of themes that lay out posts before hand for you. My favorite feature of the Hugo that we have found thus far is the implementation of html into the coding which to me personally is much easier and made it much simpler. The feasibility that Hugo gives to change attributes like the title, date, and whether or not it was live. WordPress you can change and update before pushing it to the live platform first too, but it does take some more work to disable the visual editor so most of the design is in their block layout and dropping in sections that they code for you automatically. Hugo was good in terms of making something quick but for readiness and speed WordPress would get the job done much faster. WordPress starting to make a post was very simple with a header and was very simple to type in things, put an image in, a table in, or even a quote in.
