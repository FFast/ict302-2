    <p>   This week we discussed the dichotomy between Hugo and Wordpress, two different content management systems. I definitely think Wordpress is easier, but if I wanted to make a website in a day, I would use Hugo. Soemthing I often say when asked about which programming language is best is that I think about them like different artistic mediums. Like, if you were doing a landscape, you could use oil, acryllic, or watercolor paints. They all have different stregths and weaknesses, so it depends. And you definitely would not use pottery. I suppose if all you know how to use is ceramics, then I suppose you could make it work, it would just be difficult. So to with programming. Sure you could try and make an app in Python, but really C++ would be much better. </p>
