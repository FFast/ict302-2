Today our tinkering assignment was to mess with some of the code within our layout folder. Within my group folder, I had and trial-and-error experience when trying to alter some of the code to change the attributes within our local site. But, I was able to alter the color of the text for our summary post under the file 'summary with an image. I was able to do this by changing a part of the altering the command of code for the text to be a pink color instead of the original color-coded dark grey. This assignment was to show us what these CMSs do behind the scenes of creating layout code for the user of their site. I did enjoy this activity, and I hope the eventually of getting an understanding of what is incorporated into the back-coding process.
