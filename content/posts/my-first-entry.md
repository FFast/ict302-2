For this week we had an lecture on the content modeling.
Before even working on content modeling I had question if the background for such subject would be equivalent to informational architecture. Within this conent modeling lecture we talked about the parts of model and what is the visble needed content to create an post which is title, timestamp, post and tags. 

Even while creating this post I realized how comes into creating content and how having such platform can be has to be handle with deep thoughts. Hopefully after creating thee first couple of posts I will get adjusted into making creating such models with no hesitiation. Here's to new beginnings.
