    <p>   This week we worked on our Wordpress site. Last week, Zach and I threw names around, and the only snake related name we could come up with was ConstrictorChess. It took Taylor all of a minute to point out that CobraChess works much better. So we're making CobraChess now. The focus today was to kind of flesh out the site a bit. We've decided on an up then out approach. That is we are making an outline, making sure we have the features we want before trying to get it all together, and adding more content. This goes to our group contract because we are focusing on everything being there, rather than what is there working perfectly.</p>
