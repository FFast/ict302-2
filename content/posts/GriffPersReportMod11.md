    <h3>Griff Personal Report Module 11</h3>
    <p>   This week we looked at expanding the capabilites of our CMS with extensions. This is a key concept of Content Management Systems, or just about any modern piece of software. Everything from Python to Minecraft features (or has found) a way to expand from the base features of the program. Of course each discipline has their own special word for it, mods in video games, DLC if they're paid, libraries in programming, and extensions in most other areas. The idea of "this thing does not do what I want, but I think it should" is one I am very familiar with. Mostly from video games, but also from coding. I like being able to see how it applies to CMSes, and being familiar with it is something that i think will pay dividends down the road.</p>
