    <p>   Given that I consider VS Code a perfectly adequate GUI, I looked at the Search and Starter Kits pages first. The interesting kit I saw on the Starter Kits was Hyas. The promises of SEo and security warranted a click, I thought. The GutHub was a bit austere, but it was interesting none the less. The various search options were neat, especially the separate extension for the Mandarin-language characters. That was not something I was really thinking about. If it was my site, I would likely try and implement a search myself, mostly cause I enjoy messing around in the "guts" of the code. For this reason I would not really call any of the extensions to be really unhelpful or bad, but just not soemthing I would use. However I just look at the Editor plugins for VS Code and hee hoo this might be fun. Interestly large proportion of obviously malicious Chinese and Russian fake extensions.</p>
