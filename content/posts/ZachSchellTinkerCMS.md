    There are several other CMS's out there that are widley used such as Magento which is now part of Adobe and requires an Adobe licence or there is also a free version with more limited capabilities.

    I could see this one dayy being useful if i ever made an online store becuase it is meant for for e-commerce. Im impressed by how much it was prchaced for just by my reading. It was purched for over a billion doallars in 2018.

    The other one that caught my attention is concrete CMS. It does cost and you have to reach out to them to start using it, They offer hosting or to let you host on your own server. It is meant for users to easily put content on the web, similar to WordPress.
