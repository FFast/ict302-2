    There are several other CMS's out there that are widely used such as Magento which is now part of Adobe and requires an Adobe licensee or there is also a free version with more limited capabilities.

    I could see this one day being useful if I ever made an online store because it is meant for for e-commerce. I'm impressed by how much it was purchased for just by my reading. It was purchased for over a billion dollars in 2018.

    The other one that caught my attention is concrete CMS. It does cost and you have to reach out to them to start using it, They offer hosting or to let you host on your own server. It is meant for users to easily put content on the web, similar to WordPress.
