Workflow process
1.Concept of post/blog(anyone involved/creative team)
2.Draft of written content/addign tags to categorize post(writers, with use of the true function on hugo)
3.Dates for content to be published on(using hugo publishDate feature by publisher)
4.Create the ability to see previously updated info(using lastmod by writers)
5. Writing of core info(writers)
6. Making sure core info is correct and ready to post(editors)
7.Add an expiration date for post staying on main page (expiryDate-hugo/Publisher)
8.Move to archives(if needed) (aliases-hugo)

Some helpful additions to this workflow would be the use of microsoft word or a similar text editor, and a communication/organzation software such as slack or basecamps to help keep everyone on the same page.
