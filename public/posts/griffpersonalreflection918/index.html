    <h3>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning</h3>
    <p>   This week one of the things I completed was enabling Hugo posts to be written in HTML. This is usefule because many nerds enjoy writing in HTML, and having to use Markdown is a little like asking Picasso to paint a fence. Yeah, he can do it, but he's gonna be pissed he can't do what he's really trained for. To do this, I had to read through the Hugo documentation, and understand how Hugo worked. Honestly, one I realized I didn't have to write in Assembly or C, it was cake. The trick is, Hugo was already converting the Markdown to HTML. However, it is not the best practice to let your program just run whatever code it comes across. This is why the option we had to turn to true was called unsafe.</p>
