    <p>   Today, we made a teams space for out group. From there, we discussed what we envisioned for the workflow. First, we will set up the site. Things like the theme, setting up the github, and determining the domain. We discussed what would eb on the site, such as the home, download, about, and support pages. We anticipated the most complex page to be the download page, as downloading something is not something many of us are familiar with. We also anticipate a more detailed breakdown of responsibilities to come as we actually get our hands on the site. It is also worth noting Zach has professed his undying appreciation to Griff for allowing in-line HTML in Posts.</p>
