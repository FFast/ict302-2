The first thing I noticed about WordPress is that it had a comments section, which makes it better for communication when building a website, in such ways as we are doing in class. I also noticed that there&rsquo;s a  place to upload media within WordPress that I don&rsquo;t see provided for Hugo, which I know there is probably code needed for users to upload such media entities. With WordPress, you can see what your page looks like as you&rsquo;re going through the process of adding such things to it. While for Hugo you have to go through the local server to see what&rsquo;s outputted within your webpage. Both content management sites have the main page to the websites and pages for the posts individually. I believe you can add tags to both sites though, there is a separate section for that on WordPress, which probably makes it easier to find access to certain posts. I don&rsquo;t mind the back coding required for Hugo because that allows more options for personal customizations for the users of the sites. WordPress very much can do something that Hugo couldn&rsquo;t.  For example, there is access to communication within the WordPress site which wasn&rsquo;t available within Hugo. There&rsquo;s a way to create categories for posts that make the upkeep for the posts more accessible.</p>
