<p>Today within <strong>Hugo</strong> we started and made the first post of content. Form this I Can see a different content model than what I am use to and work with it.
This is all one content of a post, but the attributes can be different. We have a title attribute, the date, and this body text which while all in the same post and all text they have different attributes. Overall this new language is weird.</p>
