I used the Paper Mod theme on the Hugo themes page that I found and liked. It looked clean and simple setup and a bit different instead of boxes it is more rows for the posts. With presentation comes comfort. To add this onto the theme you can switch easily between light and dark mode depending on which one you like. The theme of a website sets the presentation as a whole and makes it interesting to work on and read through. Another interesting thing is when you click on a post there is a slight zoom animation before switching pages to make it seem more smooth. Deciding on the exact theme and layout for our class website will be interesting to work on Friday to talk and see what direction the group wants to go.</p>
