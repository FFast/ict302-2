      I can find and use resources for self-directed learningThis week one of the things I completed was enabling Hugo posts to be written in HTML. This is usefule because many nerds enjoy writing in HTML, and having to use Markdown is a little like asking Picasso to paint a fence. Yeah, he can do it, but he's gonna be pissed he can't do what he's really trained for. To do this, I had to read through the Hugo documentation, and understand how Hugo worked.

      This was made in htmlThis week we started looking over how we would work together as a team effectively. We did this by setting up a Microsoft Teams group so that we could lay out tasks and assign them to each other to be able to see where we are the different steps.

      I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This week we had set up our groups workflow for our WordPress website. I had started an outline of the workflow on Microsoft Teams. Where I had broken up the process of making content in pieces. For example, the main buckets I had made were: To Do, Drafts, In Progress, Need For Edits, and Finished.

      Today, we made a teams space for out group. From there, we discussed what we envisioned for the workflow. First, we will set up the site. Things like the theme, setting up the github, and determining the domain. We discussed what would eb on the site, such as the home, download, about, and support pages. We anticipated the most complex page to be the download page, as downloading something is not something many of us are familiar with.

      Theoretical WorkflowWorkshoppingThe first step is to determine the full scope of the content. This would be storyboarding, making blueprints, or other technical details of what the content will look like in the end. By the end of this, there should be a clear understanding of what the final product will look like, or at least what it will do. Depending on the content, this would include creatives, designers, various support personel.

      List of steps/people that are needed to complete an proper workflow process includes:
Coming up with concept/idea of post (any position could do this; possibly creative team) Creation of brief description/draft (writer,with the use of the true feature on hugo.) Sets date to be published (publishDate-hugo/Publisher) Creates space for updates (lastmod-hugo/Writer) Writing out details of concept (writer) Edits concept of post (editor) Makes sure to clean up grammatic errors (writer) Has an expiration date for post staying on main page (expiryDate-hugo/Publisher) Move to archives(if needed) (aliases-hugo/Informational Architect)
