      Within Hugo we have been able to make a blog website to upload these posts very simply within a design. WordPress also has a similar format of themes that lay out posts before hand for you. My favorite feature of the Hugo that we have found thus far is the implementation of html into the coding which to me personally is much easier and made it much simpler. The feasibility that Hugo gives to change attributes like the title, date, and whether or not it was live.

      I can compare content management systems. Last week our class was exposed to the backcoding of Hugo. We got to see the complexity of the code to make certain customizations. This give us an idea of what we could see in WordPress but with more simplicity.

      The "I can" statement for thsi week would be I can find resources for self-directed learning. When dividning up the groupwork into differnet tasks, I was given the role of creating a forum for the website. Because of this I went to other companies forums to investigate how theirs worked, as well as looking up tutorials on how to make and manage a forum.

      What Would A Work BeThe Home and download pages fit well, navigation on all pages, and there is an available download also on the home page for easy access. There are no grammar issues and everything flows well. Delivered to Editor (Taylor) well before due date with time to check and do several revisions. Well edited over Griff's posts and there are no editing issues there.What Would B Work BeThe pages get done and but they don't flow so well, no download easily accessible on the home page, there is navigation on the page and it is styled.

      This week our class did an dummy group website in Hugo. Introduced to this assignment by an Anake sample site and its code for the cite. The goal of the assignment was to see the amount of work goes into making code for a decently designed and coordinated Hugo site. For today we started creating our Personal Contracts. But, before we had did so we had discussed what roles and pages that we would be creating or doing.

      Our group has decided to take a content specific approach with the way we will divide the work. Each person is in charge of creating one page for the website, with the exception of one person, who will create 2. I will be in charge of creating the forum page, which will allow users to interact with the company and each other in order to better use our product. It will help users troubleshoot problems they may have and ask the community questions in a public format.

      I will do the Documentation page. This will include at least 5 functions, with examaples and usage. Zach will cover the header with the Home Page, and the Download page. It is my responsibility that my page includes what we agreed to, and flows with the rest of the site, in terms of style. Including the mentioned items will result in a B, and an A if they fit witht he style of the site (as outlined in the group contract).

      This week we had created a dummy hugo site version of WordPress. In order to have an idea of our goal with this dummy site we had looked over an example of Hugo, which had extensive coding. After looking over such sample our tech lead had decided for us to make an version of WordPress thorugh a new hugo site. I had a bit of trouble to figuring the ends and outs of it.
