      This week we discussed the dichotomy between Hugo and Wordpress, two different content management systems. I definitely think Wordpress is easier, but if I wanted to make a website in a day, I would use Hugo. Soemthing I often say when asked about which programming language is best is that I think about them like different artistic mediums. Like, if you were doing a landscape, you could use oil, acryllic, or watercolor paints.

      Because our company is advertising a python library, most forms of social media don't exactly fit our image. There is no real benefit to advertise a python library on youtube, and definelty not on tiktok. The only soical media that we should consider would be twitter for social presence of the company, and maybe a link to the github.Social media incorparation doesnt exactly fit in with our theme, but it is helpful for any compnay to have at least some sort of social media presence.

      Yesterday in class we discussed about what social media accounts we woanted to be connected to our Hugo site. So, we statred listing know social media sites that can be connetced to our site. Now, so far I know that we had agreed on having Twitter and Github connected to our site. Unfornately though we were not able to create such interlinks between platforms. Which I know we will be able to complete sometime soon.

      SocialsWe agreed that the imprtant socials for our hypothetical organization are GitHub and Twitter. Youtube, instagram, and facebook do not match the tone of out organization, and that goes double for tiktok. We have no need of video based content, and the informal nature of facebook undermines the professional vibes we want. I actually was resistant to adding twitter, but Zach made the good point that it could be like a companies official social media outlet.

      The group today didn't really get how to put the social media tags on the Hugo website. We did figure out that having a twitter, GitHub, and maybe even a stack overflow links on our website might be good as a python library. The ability to share from the forums page as well would lead to the public being able to spread the work of forum posts for help. onto other media channels as a way so the company doesn't have to advertise themselves on their.

      I can describe and compare content management systems. This past week we had just started working/exploring the WordPress platform. We got to explore some of the most notable functions of WordPress, for one like I had mentioned on my tinkering assignment last week, I had noticied how there an accessibility of open communication within this particular CMS. Unlike the previous CMS we have worked on, Hugo, which doesnt have a place for commentary amongust users.

      I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. This week I looked for a way to add forum capability to our wordpress site. Through my research I found bbPress, which was a wordpress plugin that adds a highly rated forum capability.

      This week our group started our wordpress site and figured out who would have what permissions to the site. We decided everyone would have the same permissions at the start, and if we need to change it, we will. WE also chose a theme, Neve and downloaded the bbPress plugin to have the ability to create a forum.

      Hugo and WordPress are different in various ways. The first thing I noticed about WordPress is that it had a comments section, which makes it better for communication when building a website, in such ways as we are doing in class. I also noticed that there&rsquo;s a place to upload media within WordPress that I don&rsquo;t see provided for Hugo, which I know there is probably code needed for users to upload such media entities.

      In Hugo, the primary things I can do are making new posts, and editing with inline HTML. I already knew how to do both of these in Wordpress, but I do like the terminal focus of Hugo. Maybe it just makes me feel like I'm in War Games, but I kinda liked the way Hugo worked. That said, Wordpress is way easier. That said, if I were going to build a website in a day, I would use Hugo.
