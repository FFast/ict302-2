I decided to pick the theme m10c, which to me looked very techy-looking. Especially since we are making in fake Python website, I thought this was very suitable for our current project. Within this process, we had to download the selected theme within its Hugo theme folder. I clicked on the click-down of &lsquo;code&rsquo; and selected the option to download the zip. I was lost for this part for a quick second until getting some verification from the project partner. Then after doing so, I was supposed to copy the folder into the ict 302-2 fold under themes and below the anake folder, but instead, I had accidentally selected all the parts of the file instead of the folder itself to copy into this particular section. But once I had it in the location I needed to, I created a folder &rsquo;test_theme&rsquo; where I had copied all the components of the folder into the new folder itself. I deleted the set components  I  copied into the folder, that was outside of it. Then, I opened the folder within the sublime text and edited the part that said &lsquo;anake&rsquo; to the new folder I created. Then I had to run this within the localhost, which at first I thought I knew how to open the localhost but, I realized that I was somewhat lost. I then realized that path to get to localhost and get its access is by coding the &lsquo;cd ict 302-2&rsquo; and &lsquo;hugo server -D&rsquo; before the &lsquo;Ctrl+C&rsquo; part. Only then was I able to view the theme through the local host. After, I had check the website out for a minute. I then deleted the changes of files within my GitHub, which ultimately delete the theme.</p>
