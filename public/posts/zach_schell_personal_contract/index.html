<h2>What Would A Work Be</h2>
</br>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Home and download pages fit well, navigation on all pages,  and there is an available download also on the home page for easy access. There are no grammar issues and everything flows well. Delivered to Editor (Taylor) well before due date with time to check and do several revisions. Well edited over Griff's posts and there are no editing issues there.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</br>
<h2>What Would B Work Be</h2>
</br>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The pages get done and but they don't flow so well, no download easily accessible on the home page, there is navigation on the page and it is styled. Delivered to Editor (Taylor)  before due date with time to check over maybe once or twice. Edited over Griff's posts but missed things.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</br>
<h2>What Would C Work Be</h2>
</br>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    C work would be B work but not even good to look at. Like imagine a sore thumb and staring at that. Pages are there but they look like a different site. Things are thrown together and obviously not read over well. Rushed to Editor and obviously ignored editing Griff's posts.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</br>
<h2>What Would D Work Be</h2>
</br>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Pages are not done. Navigation is not done. Things do not flow well and lacking in all departments. I don't understand the difference in D and F work so these are kind of the same.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</br>
<h2>Just Fail Me</h2>
</br>
<blockquote>
  <p>
      I don't do anything and the sites get done the last day and very sloppy.
  </p>
