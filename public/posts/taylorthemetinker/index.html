<p>The theme I chose for this tinkering activity was terminal. It did not look as good as I thought it would, but i didnt know what felt off about it. It really helped nail home how presentation affects what information we see. The more a theme fits, the more corfortable reading the information at hand. If the theme is too over the top or looks bad, it detracts from the content itself. Aaliyah pciekd a more better theme, and it looked nice compared to terminal. </p>
